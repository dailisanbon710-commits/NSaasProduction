**Why it matters:**
The best sales reps talk LESS. When customers talk more, they:
• Share more pain points (more ammo for you!)
• Feel heard and understood
• Convince themselves to buy

**Quick fixes:**
1. After asking a question, COUNT TO 3 before speaking again
2. Use "Tell me more about that..." to encourage elaboration
3. Replace statements with questions
   ❌ "Our solution handles that"
   ✅ "How are you currently handling that?"

📉 **Current Status:** Needs Immediate Attention

**Root Cause Analysis:**
• Discovery questioning: 45/100 (critical weakness)
• Qualification: 38/100 (missing BANT framework)
• Objection handling: 55/100 (too defensive)
• Rapport: 80/100 (his strength - leverage this!)

**Recommended Actions:**

1️⃣ **This Week:** One-on-one call review session
   • Listen to his Jennifer Wu call together
   • Pause at key moments and ask "What else could you ask here?"

2️⃣ **Shadow Emma Rodriguez**
   • Emma's discovery score: 92/100
   • Have Tom observe her David Kim call
   • Debrief: What did Emma do differently?

3️⃣ **Role-Play Practice** (30 min sessions)
   • You play difficult prospect
   • Focus on open-ended questions
   • Record and review together

4️⃣ **Set Clear Goals:**
   • Improve discovery score to 60+ within 2 weeks
   • Reduce talk ratio from 78% to 50%

1️⃣ **Objection Handling (90/100)**
   • Never gets defensive
   • Uses "Feel, Felt, Found" technique
   • Example: "I understand how you feel. Many clients felt the same way initially. What they found was..."

2️⃣ **Product Knowledge**
   • Speaks with confidence and authority
   • Ties features directly to customer pain points
   • Never says "I'll get back to you"

3️⃣ **Discovery Questions**
   • Uses SPIN framework consistently
   • Asks follow-up questions that dig deeper
   • Listens more than she talks (45/55 ratio)

**How to Scale Sarah's Methods:**

📚 **Team Training Session (45 min)**
• Play 2-3 clips from Sarah's best calls
• Breakdown her objection handling step-by-step
• Group role-play using her techniques

📋 **Create a Playbook**
• Document Sarah's top 10 objection responses
• Share her discovery question templates
• Make it a living document team can access

🎯 **Peer Coaching**
• Pair Sarah with Tom for 2 weeks
• Weekly 30-min shadow sessions
• Sarah shares real-time thought process

📊 **Team Average:** ${Math.round(avgScore)}/100

**Biggest Team Weakness:** Economic Buyer Identification (avg 45/100)

**Why This Matters:**
63% of lost deals happen because reps never spoke to the decision-maker. Your team is losing qualified opportunities at the finish line.

**This Week's Training Plan:**

🎯 **Monday Team Meeting (30 min)**
"Who Really Signs the Check?"

Agenda:
• 5 min: Share Emma's FinanceHub deal (she identified CFO early)
• 10 min: Champion vs Economic Buyer framework
• 10 min: Role-play: "How to ask 'Who else is involved in this decision?'"
• 5 min: Set weekly goal: Every rep must identify EB in next 5 calls

📝 **New Call Requirement:**
Add "Decision-Making Process" section to call notes
- Who needs to approve this?
- What's their role?
- Have they been involved yet?

🎬 **Thursday Review:**
Quick 15-min standup - each rep shares:
- Did you identify the Economic Buyer?
- What question worked?
- What was challenging?

**Expected Impact:** +15% close rate within 30 days

• Main issues: Discovery (45), Qualification (38)
• Action: Immediate 1-on-1 coaching session
• Timeline: Daily check-ins for 2 weeks

⚠️ **Watch List:**
Currently all other reps are performing well, but monitor:
• Sarah's closing score (78) - below her usual standard
• Emma's urgency creation - could be more assertive

**Early Warning Signs to Watch:**
✓ Two consecutive weeks of declining scores
✓ Talk ratio above 70%
✓ Call reluctance (cancellations, no-shows)
✓ Negative attitude in team meetings

**Preventive Measures:**
1. Weekly 1-on-1s with each rep (even top performers)
2. Celebrate wins publicly
3. Create psychological safety for asking questions
4. Provide specific, actionable feedback

🏆 **Overall Score:** 88/100 (Team Leader)
📈 **Trend:** ⬆️ +5 this week (strong momentum)

**Why Emma Excels:**

**Discovery (92/100)** ⭐ Team Best
• Masters the "5 Whys" technique
• Uncovers pain points others miss
• Example: In her David Kim call, she went 3 levels deep on the multi-currency issue

**Key Differentiator:**
Emma doesn't just find pain points - she quantifies them.
"How many hours per week does this cost your team?"
"What's the dollar impact of these delays?"

**What Emma Could Improve:**
• Closing (85) - could be more assertive
• Creating urgency - sometimes too consultative
• Ask for the business more directly

**How to Leverage Emma:**

1️⃣ **Make her a peer coach** - pair with Tom
2️⃣ **Record best practices** - create training library
3️⃣ **Team presentation** - have her share her discovery framework
4️⃣ **Promotion path** - consider team lead role
